title: 2016 progress
---

We are ramping up well for 2016. Its been alot of work getting up and ready, but we're getting close. We are hoping for the official final release to happen the Sunday after kickoff.

Speaking of which, here are some of the features we will have or are hoping to have at release:
 
* The entirety of the WPILib, minus a few simple things, tested and ready for teams to use.
* NuGet package support, which allows us to easily update the WPILib and provide it to teams.
* Some new base classes for teams to use, including the new Attributed Command Robot, which allows for teams to easily create command based robots without much of the boiler code usually needed.
* Full support for the new ntcore library for NetworkTables communication.
* A Visual Studio extension with full support for downloading the runtime, and quickly and reliably deploying code to the robot. In addition, templates are included for ease of creating new robot projects in both C# and Visual Basic.
* A fully functional simulator backend. We are working on some front ends for this. We hope to have a Windows Forms front end for just viewing the IO, and a MonoGame front end for an actual GUI simulator.

We hope FIRST Stronghold holds up well, and teams can use DotNet code to make their robots even better.
